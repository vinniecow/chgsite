<p><strong>FY 2016 Transportation, Housing and Urban Developments (T-HUD) Appropriations Bill</strong></p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved the $55.65 billion FY 2016 THUD appropriations bill, making the measure available for Senate floor consideration. A number of amendments were offered to increase funding for Amtrak, TIGER grants, New Starts, and Passenger Train Control implementation, but none were adopted.&nbsp; A partisan battle in the Senate over sequestration may prevent the THUD bill from getting Senate floor time.&nbsp; If that occurs, it is likely that USDOT programs, as well as many other federal agency programs, would be funded through a Continuing Resolution at last year&rsquo;s levels as of the <span data-term="goog_58716928">October 1</span> start of the new fiscal year.&nbsp;The full House previously approved its version of the bill on June 10.

<p><strong>Senate Committee Approves Six-Year Transportation Bill</strong></p>
<p>The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously approved a six-year surface transportation reauthorization, called the DRIVE Act (S. 1647). The bill proposes to spend $278 billion on transportation projects over the six-year period, or about $46 billion a year, which is slightly above current MAP-21 spending levels. However, the bill doesn&rsquo;t contain a proposal to fill the looming Highway Trust Fund shortfall. Similar to a mechanism devised for the WRRDA bill last year, the Senate&rsquo;s bill contains the &ldquo;next best thing to earmarks,&rdquo; authority for FHWA to submit a list of &ldquo;projects of high importance&rdquo; to the House and Senate authorizing committees, which would then approve $350 million worth of those projects annually.

At some point in July, Congress will have to pass another extension of MAP-21 since the latest short-term bill expires on <span data-term="goog_58716929">July 31</span>.&nbsp; One big difference with the next extension is that Congress will have to identify at least $10B in new revenue or spending cuts in order to fund the highway and transit programs through the end of the calendar year.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Aviation</strong></p>
<p>This week House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA) is expected to introduce the House version of a bi-partisan&nbsp;FAA reauthorization bill&nbsp;which will propose privatizing the air traffic control system.&nbsp; The bill may be marked up in committee as early as <span data-term="goog_58716930">July 9</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Online Sales Tax Bill Introduced by Congressman Chaffetz</strong></p>
<p>Rep. Jason Chaffetz introduced the Remote Transactions Parity Act (RTPA), H.R. 2775, his legislative response to the Marketplace Fairness Act (MFA). MFA passed the Senate by a final vote of 69-27 in May 2013. RTPA&rsquo;s policy changes align closely with MFA&rsquo;s, authorizing the collection of remote sales tax by 45 states with statewide sales taxes and Alaska. Enactment of an online sales tax bill would generate at least an estimated $23 billion in new tax revenue for states nationwide, benefitting local governments as well.</p>

<p><strong>SCOTUS Supports HUD Fair Housing Rule</strong></p>
<p>In the case of Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that HUD may now move forward on enforcing its Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule, which guards against certain forms of housing discrimination, such as predatory lending, exclusionary zoning, and development policies that limit affordable housing.

<p><strong>Proposed Rule to Expand Overtime Pay</strong></p>
