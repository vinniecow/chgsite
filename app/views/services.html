            <h4>Working with Congress</h4>
            <p>The CHG analyzes pending legislation that could favorably or negatively impact funding or policy for clients. We develop positions on legislation and implementation strategies to be communicated to delegation staff, appropriations and authorizing committee staff, and to Members, either in writing, in person, over the phone, or by oral testimony. CHG helps prepare policy requests for your Members of Congress and appropriate congressional committees, including but not limited to increasing funding for the Bus and Bus Facilities program, expanding use of Federal funds for operating assistance, and streamlining the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Small Starts process. The firm will connect CAT to key lawmakers representing interests across the country and in particular will work closely with the Georgia delegation, including Senators Isakson and Perdue, Representative Carter, and their DC and district staff. These connections will be enhanced by the fact that for over 15 years, Ms. Graves has maintained strong relationships with transportation authorizers and appropriators and their staff in both the House and Senate.</p>
